## Learning Outcomes

The [lessons leading up to this project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/advanced-html-and-css)
introduced CSS animations, transitions/transforms, accessibility, and responsive web design principles. This project allowed me to apply these techniques to create a user-friendly, responsive homepage.

**Overview**:

- _responsive design_: Designed to be naturally responsive and adaptable to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Media queries were used as needed.
- _accessability_: Effort was made to improve the page's accessability. Interactive elements are accompanied by accessibility text, and icon links are hidden from screen readers when appropriate. The color palette was chosen to ensure high contrast and readability across the page.
- _transitions/transforms_: These CSS features are utilized to provide smooth theme transitions and engaging hover effects. They also allow aligning positioned elements and creating the diagonal background in the 'About Me' section.
